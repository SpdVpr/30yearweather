## ✅ TÝDEN 1: Reddit Blitz (10-15 backlinků)

### Proč Reddit?
- **Dofollow links** (pomáhají SEO)
- **Vysoký traffic** (20M+ users)
- **Rychlá indexace** (Google indexuje Reddit okamžitě)
- **Nízká bariéra vstupu**

### Target Subreddits:

#### 1. r/Prague (51k members)
**Hledat threads:**
- "When should I visit Prague?"
- "Best time to visit Prague"
- "Prague weather"
- "Planning Prague trip"

**Šablona odpovědi:**
```
I actually built a tool for exactly this using 30 years of NASA satellite data!

For Prague specifically:
- **Best months:** May & September (20-22°C, ~15% rain chance)
- **Avoid:** January-February (freezing, -2°C average)
- **Wedding season:** Late May to early June (perfect outdoor weather)

You can check day-by-day historical weather here: https://30yearweather.com/prague

It shows you what the weather was like on every date for the past 30 years, so you can plan with confidence. Hope this helps!
```

**Konkrétní threads (použijte Reddit search):**

#### 2. r/weddingplanning (570k members)
**Hledat:**
- "outdoor wedding weather"
- "wedding date weather"
- "how to avoid rain wedding"

**Šablona:**
```
I used to stress about this until I found historical weather data!

Check out https://30yearweather.com - it shows you the actual probability of rain for any date based on 30 years of NASA data.

For example:
- May 15 in Prague: 15% rain chance historically
- August 20 in Bali: 45% rain chance (monsoon season!)

Way more reliable than checking a 7-day forecast 6 months before your wedding. You can see exactly which dates have the lowest rain risk in your city.

Helped me pick my date with confidence! 💍

**Šablona:**
```
Pro tip: Check historical weather data before booking!

I use https://30yearweather.com to see what the weather was actually like on specific dates over the past 30 years.

Way better than trusting a random blog's "best time to visit" list.

```
I analyzed 30 years of NASA satellite data to answer this scientifically:

**Best Months to Visit Prague:**

1. **May (Peak Recommendation)**
   - Temperature: 18-22°C (perfect!)
   - Rain probability: Only 15% historically
   - Crowds: Moderate (before summer rush)
   - Why: Spring blooms, outdoor beer gardens open, long daylight hours

2. **September (Second Best)**
   - Temperature: 16-20°C
   - Rain: 18% probability
   - Crowds: Lower than summer
   - Why: Golden autumn colors, harvest festivals, comfortable walking weather

3. **June (Good but crowded)**
   - Temperature: 20-24°C
   - Rain: 20% probability
   - Crowds: High (peak season)
   - Why: Warmest month, longest days

**Months to Avoid:**

- **November:** Grey, rainy (35% rain chance), cold

I built a tool using 30 years of historical data where you can check any specific date: [30YearWeather Prague](https://30yearweather.com/prague)

It shows you day-by-day what the weather was actually like for the past 3 decades, so you can pick your dates with confidence. Based on actual data, not guesses.
